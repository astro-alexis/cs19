				Rationale
			</h3>
			<!-- TO-DO: Replace this extract from "The fall of the house of Usher" with your actual Scientific motivation -->
			<p>
				There have been extraordinary advances in our knowledge of asymptotic giant
	branch (AGB) stars over the last decade. On the observational side results
	from Spitzer, Herschel, VERA and ALMA in particular have provided access to
	the wavelength ranges in which these stars and their associated dust and
	molecular shells emit most of their energy. Interferometry has enabled
	convection cells to be resolved and has highlighted the role of binary
	interactions in the mass-loss process from these  huge stars. At the same
	time theoretical advances give us a better understanding of element formation,
	3D models of convection, and new insight into the properties of grains
	produced in the very extended circumstellar environments. Nucleosynthesis
	models are making testable predictions and population synthesis models are
	reproducing many of the characteristics of highly evolved stars, for the first
	time.
			</p>
			<p>
				 This splinter session will be split over 2 afternoons as follows:
			</p>
			<h4>Monday 6 June</h4>
			<p>
				<strong>
					 Session (1): From waves to winds: gas dynamics in evolved stars
				</strong></br>
				Luminous cool giants are strongly affected by dynamical processes. Large-scale convective motions and stellar pulsation trigger sound waves, which may develop into strong shock waves as they propagate outwards through the stellar atmospheres. These shocks, possibly supported by other physical processes (rotation, magnetic fields), intermittently lift gas to distances where dust grains can form and trigger a stellar wind. Recent developments in instrumentation allow us to image the relevant regions in ever increasing detail over a wide wavelength range, from the optical to the radio regime (e.g., VLTI, CHARA, ALMA), giving unprecedented insights into these phenomena. At the same time, dynamical models of interior dynamics (3D convection, pulsation) and of atmospheres and winds have reached a level where they permit self-consistent quantitative simulations of these processes. Significant progress can be expected from a detailed confrontation of latest 3D models and imaging observation.
			</p>
			<h4>Tuesday 7 June</h4>
			<p>
				<strong>
					 Session (2): The circumstellar environment of cool giants
				</strong></br>
				Evolved stars eject much of their mass into space through extreme winds.
The ejecta form an expanding shell around the star, extending from the dust
formation radius at 2 stellar radii to the asteropause at 1-4 parsec where the
merger with the interstellar medium takes place. Although the winds are
thought to be largely spherically symmetric, recent observations show growing
evidence for strong shaping. The ESO VLT and ALMA have found evidence for
spirals, circumstellar disks, bipolar flows and jets, and even wind-blown
tails. The dominant shaping mechanisms is believed to be angular momentum,
which for most of stellar evolution is in cold storage in stellar, sub-stellar
and planetary companions, but is transferred to the shells through dynamical
interactions. Related processes act in supergiants and their supernovae,
common envelope systems and stellar mergers: together the stars cover most of
the HR diagram. We will bring together observers and theoreticians to discuss
the shaping mechanisms over a wide range of stellar properties. Topics will
include the new observations at extreme angular resolution (e.g. Sphere,
ALMA), 3D hydrodynamical models, planetary systems around evolved stars, and
common envelope evolution.

			<h3>Participation </h3>
			<p>
				Anyone interested in participating in this meeting must register for the
<a href="http://www.coolstars19.com/index.html">main CS19 meeting</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Applications to give oral (15+5 min) and contributions to this splinter
				session will open soon, and the deadline for these will be 30 March 2016 and
				a decision will be made by 15 April (TBC).
			</p>
			<p>
				Posters on this topic are also very welcome, but they should all be
				submitted to the main meeting. Those accepted will be displayed the whole
				week. The deadline for poster submission is 29 April.
