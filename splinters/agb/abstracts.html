      <h2>The coolest (sur)faces we have seen so far in the infrared</h2>
      <h3> Claudia Paladini  </h3>
      <p>
        <em>
          In the last decade, we have been able to observe the envelopes of Asymptotic
          Giant Branch and Red Supergiant stars by several different means. Many aspects
          of the evolution of these cool objects have seen several breakthroughs, thanks
          also to the high angular resolution observations able to reach down to the
          stellar surface. However the spatially resolved observations were for many
          years only limited to very few points across the stellar discs. Asymmetric
          structures have been detected, but their interpretation has been difficult and
          highly non-unique. With the advancement in the instrumentations and with the
          increasing amount of apertures available, the new generation of interferometers
          allows today to reconstruct the brightness distribution of the surface
          of these stars with incredible details. Convective patterns and asymmetric
          ejections of the size of the astronomical unit can be finally characterised. 3D
          models are slowly catching up, and are now ready to be challenged by these new
          observations. In this presentation I will review the results achieved by using
          high angular resolution techniques in the infrared. I will discuss the recently
          obtained images of the stellar surface of AGBs and RSGs, and I will conclude
          highlighting how our field of research will benefit from the advent of the
          second generation of VLTI instruments. There is enough to keep us busy for the next ten years.

      <h2>Pulsation properties of AGB star 3-D model grids</h2>
      <h3>Sofie Liljegren</h3>
      <p>
        <em>
          3D models of AGB stars have revealed complex structures, with self-excited
          pulsations. To fully understand the implications of different stellar
          parameters a grid of models of AGB stars, based on 3D star-in-a-box simulations
          using CO5BOLD, has been calculated. This grid contains 8 models with effective
          temperatures ranging from 2500K to 2800K and luminosities from 5000 to 10000
          solar luminosities. The mass of all models is kept at one solar mass. With
          several models of different stellar parameters it is possible to extract
          pulsation properties, such as period and radius, and investigate the resulting
          trends. This is used to compare with observations and corresponding properties
          of 1D models, where good consistency is found. These results indicate that the
          3D models give a satisfactory description of the stellar interior, and could be
          used to investigate the interplay between self-excited pulsation, shocks and
          dust creation.

          We present near-infrared $H$ band interferometric imaging
          observations of the carbon AGB star R Scl with the goals of
          (1) constraining and testing available dynamic atmosphere
          and wind models by near-infrared interferometry,
          (2) revealing the detailed morphology of the stellar atmosphere
          and innermost mass-loss region, and (3) constraining fundamental stellar
          properties of R Scl,  which may further constrain the binary
          companion model. Our images reveal one dominant surface spot and a spiral-like
          surface  structure, which may be caused by large-scale convection cells and/or
          localized mass loss.

      <h2>Wind models of M-type AGB stars in the LMC</h2>
      <h3>Sara Bladh</h3>
      <p>
        <em>
          Time-dependent wind models have successfully been able to reproduce both
          dynamical and photometric observations of C-type and M-type AGB stars in the
          Milky Way (e.g. Eriksson et al. 2014, Bladh et al. 2015). In the dynamical wind
          models for C-type AGB stars the outflows are predominately driven by photon
          absorption on amorphous carbon grains and in the models for M- type AGB stars
          the stellar winds are triggered by photon-scattering on Fe-free silicates. What
          happens to the wind properties of AGB stars in a low metallicity environment
          such as the LCM or SMC? C-type AGB stars produce their own carbon during the
          AGB phase and the mass-loss rates should therefore not be significantly
          affected by metallicity. The outflows in M-type AGB stars, however, are driven
          by dust material consisting of elements that cannot be produced by the stars
          themselves. A low metallicity environment could for that reason have a strong
          impact on the mass loss of these stars. In order to investigate the properties
          of M-type AGB stars in a low metallicity environment we here report the first
          tentative results from a set of wind models for M-type AGB stars with
          metallicity similar to that of the LMC. The grid is set-up much like the
          previous grid of wind models with solar metallicity (Bladh et al. 2015). The
          dynamical properties of this set verify the assumption that a low metallicity environment affects the mass loss of M-type
          AGB stars: the models produce stellar winds only for very luminous AGB stars,
          the resulting wind velocities are very low and the mass-loss rates span a
          narrow range. Current measurements of the mass-loss rates of M-type AGB stars
          in LMC, although uncertain, indicate lower mass-loss rates and higher wind velocities (Gullieuszik et al. 2012).

      <h2>AGB and RSG Stars: From the Radio to the Submm</h2>
      <h3>Elizabeth Humphreys</h3>
      <p>
        <em>
          Radio and submillimetre interferometry has enabled the study of Asymptotic
          Giant Branch (AGB) and Red Supergiant (RSG) stars from the stellar photosphere
          to the outer wind, at up to sub-milliarcsecond resolution. In this talk, I will
          focus on VLBI and ALMA observations of the gas dynamics of the stellar extended
          atmospheres / inner circumstellar envelopes (CSEs), where shocks are believed to
          play an important role in levitating gas to larger radii, enabling dust
          formation. I will also show submm continuum and maser observations that provide
          indications of asymmetry, clumpiness and inhomogeneity in the inner CSE, with
          mass loss  occurring in localised directions. Finally, I will discuss evidence
          for dynamically  important magnetic fields  permeating the CSE, and the
          questions that this generates.

      <h2> Long Baseline Radio Continuum Observations of Betelgeuse: Understanding Mass Loss in Red Supergiants </h2>
      <h3>Eamon O'Gorman</h3>
      <p>
        <em>
          Spatially resolved cm/mm/sub-mm continuum observations can be a powerful means
          by which to study the partially ionized extended atmospheres around red
          supergiants as they allow us to probe the essential region where mass loss is
          initiated. To date, only Betelguese has been spatially resolved at cm and mm
          wavelengths with the data showing that the atmosphere is highly extended and
          that the mean gas temperature beyond 2 stellar radii is cool
          (Tgas < 3000K). Here, I present the  initial results of our ALMA long baseline
          and e-MERLIN continuum observations of Betelgeuse's extended atmosphere which

        Surface magnetic field detection in M-type supergiant stars: the
        non-uniqueness of Betelgeuse
      </h2>
      <h3>Benjamin Tessore	</h3>
      <p>
        <em>
          Red supergiant stars (RSG) can be considered as the massive counterparts of
          AGBs, sharing properties such as extended atmospheres, prodigious mass loss,
          and a chemically complex circumstellar envelopes. They are also known to
          present few giant convective cells at the photospheric level. In 2010, a weak
          magnetic field has been detected at the surface of Betelgeuse. Until recently
          this was the only M-type supergiant with a direct detection of a surface field.
          With the spectropolarimeter Narval (TBL Pic du Midi, France) we have initiated
          in spring 2015 a 2-year campaign dedicated to a sample of cool evolved stars,
          including several red supergiant stars (RSG). We present detection of surface
          magnetic field in RSGs obtained from circular polarisation data and multiline
          analysis technics. Because of their slow rotation (and thus high Rossby number,
          up to 100!) convection in these stars is not expected to efficiently generate a
          global magnetic field. Our detections may thus rather point toward local
          transitory fields, which may play a role in the mass loss mechanism. I will
          also introduce the diagnosis induced by linear polarisation in these stars,
          focusing on the Betelgeuse twin Erakis.

      <h2> The dynamic atmospheres of carbon rich giants - constraining models via interferometry</h2>
      <h3>Gioia Rau (presented by Joseph Hron)</h3>
      <p>
        <em>
          Dynamic models for the atmospheres of C-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch stars are
          quite advanced and have been overall successful in reproducing spectroscopic
          and photometric observations. Interferometry provides independent information
          and is thus an important technique tostudy the atmospheric stratification and
          to further constrain the dynamic models. We observed a sample of six C-rich
          AGBs with the mid infrared interferometer VLTI/MIDI. These observations,
          combined with photometric and spectroscopic data from the literature, are
          compared with synthetic observables derived from dynamic model atmospheres
          (DMA, Eriksson et al. 2014). The SEDs can be reasonably well modelled and the
          interferometry supports the extended and multi-component structure of the
          atmospheres, but some differences remain. We discuss the possible reasons for
          these differences and we compare the stellar parameters derived from this
          comparison with stellar evolution models. Finally, we point out the high
          potential of MATISSE, the second generation VLTI instrument allowing
          interferometric imaging in the L, M, and N bands, for further progress in this
          field.

      <h2>High spatial resolution studies of the  winds of evolved stars </h2>
      <h3>Leen Decin</h3>
      <p>
        <em>
          High spatial resolution observations have provided us with an amazing view on
          the winds of evolved cool giants and supergiants. The longstanding assumption
          of smooth spherically symmetric winds seems often not validated. Large scale
          structures in the form of spirals, circumstellar disks, bipolar outflows,
          bowshocks etc. are detected and smaller scale clumpiness seems
          omnipresent. These novel data challenge our understanding of the wind launching
          process. The observations serve as critical benchmark for 3D hydrodynamical
          models. Even more, these data push the theoretical models to include a higher
          form of complexity, in particular to incorporate a (more) consistent approach
          of chemistry, dynamics, and radiative transfer. In this talk, I will give a
          review of the recent observational results obtained with ALMA, SPHERE and
          Herschel. I will show how these data yield detailed information on the wind
          structure of evolved stars and elucidate which chemical and physical phenomena
          should be captured in theoretical wind models. I will summarize ongoing efforts
          to improve these theoretical models, both in terms of numerical modeling and
          based on novel laboratory experiments. I will show how these theoretical models
          serve as a guideline to further improve the observing strategies.

        Constraining dust properties in Circumstellar Envelopes of C-stars in the

      </h2>
      <h3> Ambri Nanni </h3>
      <p>
        <em>
          We present our recent investigation aimed at constraining the typical size and
          optical properties of carbon dust grains in Circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of
          C-stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud. To achieve this goal, we apply our
          recent dust growth model, coupled with a radiative transfer code, to the CSEs
          of C-stars evolving along the TP-AGB, for which we compute spectra and
          colors. We then compare our modeled colors in the NIR and MIR bands with the
          observed ones, testing different assumptions in our dust model and employing
          several optical constants data sets for carbon dust available in the
          literature. Different assumptions adopted in our dust model change the typical
          size of the carbon grains produced. We finally constrain carbon dust properties
          by selecting the combination of typical grain size and optical constants which
          best reproduce several colors in the NIR and MIR at the same time. The approach
          is new and has never been adopted so far. We conclude that the complete set of
          selected NIR and MIR colors are best reproduced by small grains, with sizes
          between 0.06 and 0.1 microns, rather than by large grains of 0.2-0.4
          microns. Remarkably, the inability of large grains to reproduce NIR and MIR
          colors seems independent of the adopted optical data set. We also find a
          possible trend of the typical grain size with the dust reddening in the CSEs of
          these stars. We finally emphasize that this work is preparatory to follow-up
          studies aimed at calibrating the TP-AGB phase through resolved stellar
          populations in star clusters and galaxies which include dusty, mass-losing
          evolved stars.

        Modelling the interactions of cool giants with (sub)stellar companions:
        Implications for mass-transfer rates and outflow geometries

      <h3>Shazrene Mohamed</h3>
      <p>
        <em>
          Cool, evolved stars, e.g., asymptotic giant branch stars and red (super)giants,
          lose copious amounts of mass and momentum through powerful, dense stellar
          winds. The interaction of these outflows with their surroundings results in
          highly structured and complex circumstellar environments, often featuring
          knots, arcs, shells and spirals. Recent improvements in computational power and
          techniques have led to the development of detailed, multi-dimensional
          simulations that have given new insight into the origin of these structures,
          and better understanding of the physical mechanisms driving their formation. In
          this talk, I review one of the main mechanisms that shapes the outflows of
          evolved stars: interaction with a companion. I will discuss both wind-wind
          interactions where the companion also ejects a stellar outflow, and
          mass-transfer interactions where the companion has a weak or insignicant
          outflow. I will also highlight the broader implications of these stellar wind
          interactions for other phenomena, e.g, for planetary nebulae, symbiotic and
          X-ray binaries, novae and supernovae.

          dust mass injection by AGB stars in the Magellanic Clouds have been achieved
          using Spitzer data (Riebel et al. 2012; Srinivasan et al, 2016). However, the
          last estimate of the dust injection rate in the Milky Way was done in the late
          '80s for a non-all sky sample (Jura & Kleinmann 1989).  In this work we
          revisit the total dust mass-loss rate from AGB stars in the Solar
          neighborhood.  It is especially hard to evaluate distances to dusty AGB stars
          in the Milky Way, as the highest mass-loss rate objects are not in the
          Hipparcos catalogue, due to circumstellar extinction.  Using present-day
          all-sky infrared facilities (WISE, 2MASS, and others), we have constructed
          spectral energy distributions for all AGB stars within 1 kpc from the Sun. We
          use the GRAMS model grid (Sargent, Srinivasan & Meixner 2011; Srinivasan,
          Sargent & Meixner 2011) to estimate the dust production for this sample of AGB
          stars.  Preliminary results show an increase in the number of known dusty
          objects within 1 kpc. An integrated dust production rate of ~ 10^-5 Msun/year
          or an average of ~ 10^-7 Msun/year per object is obtained.  The result for the
          Solar Neighborhood will be extrapolated for the entire Milky Way, using a
          suitable stellar distribution function.  In addition, we compare our results
          to those of the Magellanic Clouds and other Local Group galaxies, for which
          the distance determination problems do not exist.  This work is a step towards
          more reliable determinations of the mass loss of AGB stars, and it aims to
          provide new insight on the discrepancy between the dust mass produced by AGB
          stars and that estimated to be present in the ISM.

        A First Look at the Circumstellar Dust Composition of O-type Mira Variables observed with Spitzer
      </h2>

          Our research concerns the detailed dust composition surrounding Mira
          variables. These regular pulsators are easily observed in the optical and
          infrared due to their changes in brightness. Data on 25 Miras were obtained
          with the Spitzer IRS instrument in 2008-09 under a GO program led by
          Creech-Eakman. The stars were observed once per month to track changes in their
          brightness and spectral features. This dataset is unique for both the number of
          observations of each star and the high SNR due to quick exposure times to avoid
          saturation of the detectors. The reduced spectra reveal a wonderful “forest” of
          features that provide insight into the stellar atmospheres and circumstellar
          dust composition. The sample of stars in this study span the range of oxygen-
          to carbon-rich, with each type exhibiting certain known solid state components
          (i.e dust). Preliminary examination of the oxygen-rich Miras shows many of the
          rimary known features, such as broad silicate emission and aluminum oxide
          (Al2O3). Using the radiative transfer modeling code, DUSTY, we are attempting
          to identify several broad, and some sharp, dust features by implementing
          recently derived laboratory spectral indeces for dust opacities. Prominent
          features seen in oxygen-rich stars include: water ice emission, as well as
          amorphous and crystalline silicates, and potentially corundum. We will show
          preliminary results for a sub- sample of the set and discuss plans for
          publishing the entire sample.

      <h2>The optical interferometry view of convection in nearby red supergiants
      </h2>
      <h3> Miguel Montarges </h3>
      <p>
        <em>
          Red supergiant (RSG) stars are the later stage of evolution of massive
          stars. The strong increase in size that massive stars experience when they
          leave the main sequence (at a mostly constant mass) causes their surface
          gravity to be very weak. This in principle favors the triggering of mass loss
          from their surface, consistently with their important observed mass loss
          rate. However, we do not know exactly which are the physical processes that
          effectively trigger the outflow. Nearby red supergiants are easy targets for
          optical/infrared interferometers, as they exhibit very large angular
          diameters. They significantly resolve the features present on their
          photosphere, in particular convective cells. I will present our recent
          observational and modeling results on the photosphere of the two nearby RSGs:
          Betelgeuse and Antares. I will also briefly present our ongoing project aiming
          at getting a better understanding of the convective activity of RSG.
