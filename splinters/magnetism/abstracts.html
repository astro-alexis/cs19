          How to measure stellar magnetic field? Its strength and orientation in full 3D or just a disk-averaged
          flux density? We will summarize the most commonly applied techniques (and assumptions) and glimpse into
          some other novel methods not yet fully appreciated in our community. We also relate to the latest and

        <h3>Challenges of cool star ZDI</h3>
        <h4>Self-consistency and four Stokes parameters</h4>
      </div>

      <p>
        <em>
          Magnetic fields strongly influence stellar and planetary evolution. It is therefore important to reconstruct
          the magnetic fields as accurately as possible. Conventional cool star ZDI studies are made using only
          circular polarization, (Stokes V), since that is usually the only type of polarization possible to detect
          in cool stars. However, numerical ZDI studies have shown that using only Stokes V is not optimal. If a
          cool spot coincides with a magnetic feature, the intensity of the polarization spectra is lowered. By not
          including Stokes I, possible temperature inhomogeneities are ignored and the low amplitude of the
          polarization profiles can be misinterpreted as a weak magnetic field. The same set of Stokes V profiles can
          correspond to different magnetic field configurations since Stokes V is not sensitive to the azimuth angle
          of the magnetic field. We therefore performed an observational study where we successfully identified the
          first cool star target suitable for four Stokes parameter ZDI. We have developed a new ZDI methodology in
          order to correctly model LSD Stokes QU profiles. The reconstructed surface temperature and magnetic field
          maps show that stronger and more complex magnetic features appear when Stokes QU are taken into account
          compared to using only Stokes IV. It is also shown that the same set of Stokes IV profiles can be fitted
          equally well to very different magnetic field configurations, and that Stokes V does not seem sensitive to
          complex field structures.

          The BCool project is an international collaboration studying the magnetic activity of low-mass stars of
          main-sequence stars, where we use spectropolarimetric observations to directly characterise the large-scale
          magnetic fields of cool stars using Zeeman-Doppler imaging. From our long-term monitoring of the large-scale
          magnetic field over nearly 10 years, we are starting to see cyclic behaviour in several targets. In this presentation
          I will show our results and highlight a few cases we find surprising cyclic behaviour compared to the Sun.

          Stars appear as point sources in our telescopes and studying their surface features is very demanding. Last couple of decades we have been able to use Doppler imaging technique for indirectly resolving different temperatures and abundances on stellar surfaces. The results have shown us that cool spots on active stars are large, long lived features that usually occur at high latitudes. During the last years a breakthrough using long baseline infrared interferometers has occurred. Images with milli-arcsecond resolution can now be produced, and also cool temperature spots on active giants can be imaged. Here we present the latest high resolution interferometric images obtained of active giants using the MIRC instrument at CHARA Array, compare these images to the results from Doppler imaging, and discuss the obtained starspot hemispheres and latitudes.

        <h3>Magnetic fields of young cool stars</h3>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Colin Folsom</strong></p>

        <em>
          Young solar-type stars evolve dramatically across the pre-main sequence and through the
          early main sequence, displaying large structural changes, the halting of accretion,
          and large changes in their rotation rates. This evolution has important consequences for
          the dynamos operating in these stars, impacting the magnetic fields displayed at their
          surface. In turn, magnetic fields play a key role in the rotational evolution and accretion
          in these stars. Observing campaigns have studied the large scale magnetic fields of a
          significant number of stars throughout this evolutionary time span. These include classical
          T Tauri stars from MaPP, weak-line T Tauri stars from MaTYSSE, zero-age main sequence stars
          from Toupies, and older field stars from BCool. The targets observed span not just a range of
          ages, but also ranges of rotation rates and masses. While many of these studies are not yet
          complete, there is a clear trend towards decreasing average large-scale magnetic field strength
          with age, and a tight correlation between large-scale magnetic field strength and Rossby
          number. Comparing the magnetic properties of these samples, it appears that the magnetic
          evolution of solar-type stars during the pre-main sequence is primarily driven by
          structural changes, while it closely follows the stars' rotational evolution on the main sequence.

        <h3>Magnetic fields of weak-line T Tauri stars</h3>
      </div>

        <em>
          The magnetic field behaviour of weak-line T Tauri stars (wTTSs) is poorly understood. Magnetic fields are known
          to play an important role in all stages of pre-main sequence stellar evolution, particularly in the accreting,
          classical T Tauri star (cTTS) phase, where it appears to control the dissipation of angular momentum and the
          funnelling of matter onto the stellar surface. Studies of the magnetic field topologies of cTTSs show a wide
          variety in their complexities and strengths; correlating strongly with the internal structure. However, relatively
          few studies have been done on the magnetic fields of wTTSs, and therefore to evaluate the effect that the presence,
          or lack thereof, of accretion has on stellar magnetic fields. We present here the preliminary results of the
          brightness and magnetic field mapping of two wTTSs, TWA 9A and V1095 Sco; stars with similar masses and spectral
          types, but differing ages and rotation periods. Both have been observed with HARPS-Pol spectropolarimeter on
          the ESO 3.6m telescope as part of the MaTYSSE project, which aims to characterise the magnetic field behaviour of wTTSs.

        <em>
          Magnetic fields, their generation by dynamo effect and the activity phenomena they induce are central to the physics of cool stars and their planetary systems throughout their evolution. Among cool stars, the least massive ones largely dominate the stellar population in the solar neighborhood, with most planets in the Milky Way likely orbiting a M dwarf. In this review I will briefly remind the main theoretical puzzles we want to address by studying the magnetic fields of low-mass stars, such as probing the dynamo response to the partly- to fully-convective and the star-brown dwarf transitions. After a summary of photospheric magnetic field measurements collected mostly during the past 10 years, the connection with magnetic field measurements of other stars (in particular young stars) and with activity measurements performed across the electromagnetic spectrum will be discussed. Finally, I will present how future instruments operating in the near infrared will contribute to the next advances in the field.

        <h4>Detecting the strongest magnetic fields in M dwarf stars</h4>

          Low mass stars generate activity via convective dynamos.
          This activity, viewed in terms
          of X-ray fluxes, increases with stellar rotation but
          saturates at rotation periods shorter than a few days.
          Dynamo models predict that maximum magnetic
          flux a star can generate scales with convective energy
          stored in its envelope.
          Available measurements indicate that fields stronger
          than about 4 kG were never detected even in fastest rotating stars.
          This was viewed as an evidence for the magnetic field saturation.
          We analyzed data available from ESPaDOnS/NARVAL (CFHT, Hawaii)
          and recently commissioned CARMENES (Calar Alto, Spain) instruments to measure magnetic fields in most active M dwarfs.
          We show for the time an evidence of a 7 kG average magnetic field
          in the star WX UMa. Our finding raises a number of fundamental
          questions about magnetism in these cool stars.

        Zeeman-Doppler Imaging continues to provide a wealth of information on stellar large-scale magnetic surface flux distribution. This technique suffers, however, from intrinsic limitations, e.g. the small-scale fields are not resolved, the strong fields in dark spots are suppressed by their low surface brightness, and the signatures of small-scale features can cancel out in some field geometries.
        <br/>
        We use the Sun to test the consequences these limitations have on our ability to reliably reconstruct large-scale magnetic maps. Using magnetograms, Dopplergrams and continuum images from the HMI instrument aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we calculate Stokes I and V profiles for the Sun as a star. We then use these calculated profiles as input data for our ZDI code, to reconstruct a large-scale magnetic map. These maps are then benchmarked against the observed solar maps to assess the effect missing small-scale fields has on the map reconstruction.

        I will discuss the technique we adapted and the results we obtained.

        <em>
          The history of exchanges between solar and stellar spectropolarimetry has been long and fruitful. This is particularly true for the study of stellar surface magnetism. The initial difficulties of stellar spectropolarimetry advised to start with the simplest of models: Zeeman effect in circular polarisation and the weak field approximation.
          As we advance in our understanding of these techniques, more and more tools from solar spectropolarimetry can be adapted to stellar conditions.
          I will review how stellar spectropolarimetry is getting rid of the weak field approximation, how it can add Zeeman linear polarimetry to its diagnostic toolbox, how linear polarisation of non-magnetic origin can be used to image stellar surfaces or how profile asymmetries can be used to get information of radial variations of the magnetic field.
