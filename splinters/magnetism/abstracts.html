          Magnetic fields strongly influence stellar and planetary evolution. It is therefore important to reconstruct
          the magnetic fields as accurately as possible. Conventional cool star ZDI studies are made using only
          circular polarization, (Stokes V), since that is usually the only type of polarization possible to detect
          in cool stars. However, numerical ZDI studies have shown that using only Stokes V is not optimal. If a
          cool spot coincides with a magnetic feature, the intensity of the polarization spectra is lowered. By not
          including Stokes I, possible temperature inhomogeneities are ignored and the low amplitude of the
          polarization profiles can be misinterpreted as a weak magnetic field. The same set of Stokes V profiles can
          correspond to different magnetic field configurations since Stokes V is not sensitive to the azimuth angle
          of the magnetic field. We therefore performed an observational study where we successfully identified the
          first cool star target suitable for four Stokes parameter ZDI. We have developed a new ZDI methodology in
          order to correctly model LSD Stokes QU profiles. The reconstructed surface temperature and magnetic field
          maps show that stronger and more complex magnetic features appear when Stokes QU are taken into account
          compared to using only Stokes IV. It is also shown that the same set of Stokes IV profiles can be fitted
          equally well to very different magnetic field configurations, and that Stokes V does not seem sensitive to
          complex field structures.

          magnetic field over nearly 10 years, we are starting to see cyclic behaviour in several targets. In this presentation

        <h3>Magnetic fields of weak-line T Tauri stars</h3>
      </div>

        <em>
          The magnetic field behaviour of weak-line T Tauri stars (wTTSs) is poorly understood. Magnetic fields are known
          to play an important role in all stages of pre-main sequence stellar evolution, particularly in the accreting,
          classical T Tauri star (cTTS) phase, where it appears to control the dissipation of angular momentum and the
          funnelling of matter onto the stellar surface. Studies of the magnetic field topologies of cTTSs show a wide
          variety in their complexities and strengths; correlating strongly with the internal structure. However, relatively
          few studies have been done on the magnetic fields of wTTSs, and therefore to evaluate the effect that the presence,
          or lack thereof, of accretion has on stellar magnetic fields. We present here the preliminary results of the
          brightness and magnetic field mapping of two wTTSs, TWA 9A and V1095 Sco; stars with similar masses and spectral
          types, but differing ages and rotation periods. Both have been observed with HARPS-Pol spectropolarimeter on
          the ESO 3.6m telescope as part of the MaTYSSE project, which aims to characterise the magnetic field behaviour of wTTSs.

          Low mass stars generate activity via convective dynamos.
          This activity, viewed in terms
          of X-ray fluxes, increases with stellar rotation but
          saturates at rotation periods shorter than a few days.
          Dynamo models predict that maximum magnetic
          flux a star can generate scales with convective energy
          stored in its envelope.
          Available measurements indicate that fields stronger
          than about 4 kG were never detected even in fastest rotating stars.
          This was viewed as an evidence for the magnetic field saturation.
          We analyzed data available from ESPaDOnS/NARVAL (CFHT, Hawaii)
          and recently commissioned CARMENES (Calar Alto, Spain) instruments to measure magnetic fields in most active M dwarfs.
          We show for the time an evidence of a 7 kG average magnetic field
          in the star WX UMa. Our finding raises a number of fundamental
          questions about magnetism in these cool stars.

        Zeeman-Doppler Imaging continues to provide a wealth of information on stellar large-scale magnetic surface flux distribution. This technique suffers, however, from intrinsic limitations, e.g. the small-scale fields are not resolved, the strong fields in dark spots are suppressed by their low surface brightness, and the signatures of small-scale features can cancel out in some field geometries.
        <br/>
        We use the Sun to test the consequences these limitations have on our ability to reliably reconstruct large-scale magnetic maps. Using magnetograms, Dopplergrams and continuum images from the HMI instrument aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we calculate Stokes I and V profiles for the Sun as a star. We then use these calculated profiles as input data for our ZDI code, to reconstruct a large-scale magnetic map. These maps are then benchmarked against the observed solar maps to assess the effect missing small-scale fields has on the map reconstruction.
        <br/>
        I will discuss the technique we adapted and the results we obtained.
