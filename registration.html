				<strong>Student Nation Guest Cards</strong><br/>
				Going out in Uppsala (or Sweden in general) can be expensive compared to other countries,
				and more particularly for students. However, Uppsala is the home to
				<a href="http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/student-life/the_student_nations/" target="_blank">student nations</a>,
				which are student associations dating from the 17th century and the heart of Uppsala's
				student life. Nowadays, each nation hosts a student pub. These are one of the only
				places in Sweden to serve untaxed alcoholic drinks. A special student card is needed to enter the
				nations, but guest passes can be purchased for 75 SEK and are valid for a week. If you are a
                student, and would
				like to get a guest pass, you can choose this during registration. You will be contacted by
				the LOC later on, requesting you to send us a copy of your passport (or national ID card), and
				a copy of your national student card, or proof of enrollment in a university. You can find more
				information about the <a href="https://uppsalastudent.com/page/nations" target="_blank">different nations, here</a>.

                Follow Carl von Linné on a tour of his <a href="http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/">home and the garden that now
                bears his name.</a> The Linné Garden was
                originally founded in 1655 as the first botanical garden in Sweden. Carl von Linné assumed responsibility
                for the garden in 1741 and arranged the garden according to his own system. The garden remains very much the same
                as it was when Linné arranged it. Within the botanical garden stands Linné's former home of 35 years, which
                has since been converted into a museum.

			<p>
                Vasaborgen is the 16th century ruins of the original Uppsala Castle. Built in 1549 by King Gustav Vasa,
                Vasaborgen was Northern Europe's most defensive fortress. Kings, queens, princes and princesses, servants
                and guests from near and far lived and stayed at the Castle. The bestial Sture murders were committed here
                in 1567 and in the Bayliff Dungeon, prisoners were held for a lifetime. It is even said that the daughter
                of Gustav Vasa, Cecilia, was so badly treated by the court that she still wanders around in the ruins causing
                mischief.
				<br/><br/>
				Cost: 150 SEK &mdash;  Time: 1 hour &mdash;  Limit: 50 participants.
