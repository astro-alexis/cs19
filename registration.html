				<strong>Student Nation Guest Cards</strong><br/>
				Going out in Uppsala (or Sweden in general) can be expensive compared to other countries,
				and more particularly for students. However, Uppsala is the home to
				<a href="http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/student-life/the_student_nations/" target="_blank">student nations</a>,
				which are student associations dating from the 17th century and the heart of Uppsala's
				student life. Nowadays, each nation hosts a student pub. These are one of the only
				places in Sweden to serve untaxed alcoholic drinks. A special student card is needed to enter the
				nations, but guest passes can be purchased for 75 SEK and are valid for a week. If you are a
				student, and would
				like to get a guest pass, you can choose this during registration. You will be contacted by
				the LOC later on, requesting you to send us a copy of your passport (or national ID card), and
				a copy of your national student card, or proof of enrollment in a university. You can find more
				information about the <a href="https://uppsalastudent.com/page/nations" target="_blank">different nations, here</a>.

				Vasaborgen is the 16th century ruins of the original Uppsala Castle. Built in 1549 by King Gustav Vasa,

				in 1567 and in the Bayliff Dungeon, prisoners were held for a lifetime. It is even said that the daughter
				of Gustav Vasa, Cecilia, was so badly treated by the court that she still wanders around in the ruins causing
				mischief.
